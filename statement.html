    <p>The mediums I used for this class was all digital. These were mediums that I personally wasn’t used to, but after this semester it has opened my eyes to new ways to produce art and express myself in different ways outside of photography. I think this could also help me change the way I take my pictures in the future, using the different software and the different programs will allow me to enhance the way I share my art. I think it will also help me be able to connect to those that want to use new software or programs into their art, that they shouldn’t be scared it is frustrating at first. With practice and few tutorials, it does get a bit easier, each tool that you learn to use does become more familiar, and then you can add it to your repertoire and enhance your art.</p>
    <p>I think the project for me that interested me the most was the composite project. It allowed my creative self to be free, it opened an infinite amount of possibilities for me. Using photoshop was a challenge, but after learning the basics it became a lot easier to use the more advance tools. Since this project mainly focused on the use of photoshop, but still being able to keep it simple I kept that piece to my skill level at the time. Which has been my motto for the semester, keep it simple and the results will be better than making the project complicated and having nothing to turn in at all.
